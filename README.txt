HELLO FRIEND!

Welcome to my Grocery Store App, which I made to keep track of the prices of things at various supermarkets. It has a 
SAVE and LOAD feature, which means you can open up the program and load a past shopping list with no problems. The program
creates a folder called "storage" which keeps all the save files. Inside "storage" is another folder called "JSON FILES" 
which holds JSON versions of the data. This might be used later with a NoSQL database once I learn more about databases. 

DISCLAIMER

I made this program to practice list comprehensions in python as well as loading files from and saving files to .txt. 
The program is pretty basic and doesn't have a GUI, but perhaps the next iteration pushed out will if I decide to learn 
how to develop them. That being said, this program shouldn't mess your computer up too bad since it's so light and frothy.

SETUP

This program should work well with any OS that has Python installed and put into the global PATH environment. Most Mac OS 
will have this automatically. 

The following files are in the repository:
-grocery.py: Clicking on this starts the program. After clicking this, the directory "storage" will be added.
-README.txt: You're looking at it!

STARTING THE PROGRAM
-Clicking on grocery.py starts the menu. 
-Words in ALL CAPS indicate what words can be typed into the system
-The first thing to do always is to save the STORES that you frequent into the system (if you aren't loading data.)

USING THE PROGRAM
The menu is pretty self explanatory; if you have any questions, please let me know!
